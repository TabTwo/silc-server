This directory includes example files for a small SILC network.  The
network consists of one router, and three (3) servers.  The cell also
has one backup router.

Cell 1:
Router                212.146.42.250	cell_router.conf
 Backup router        212.146.42.100	cell_backup.conf
 Server1              212.146.42.101	cell_server1.conf
 Server2              212.146.42.102	cell_server2.conf

To make it simple all servers and routers use the same public and private
keys.  They are the silcd.pub and silcd.prv in this directory.  Also, to
make authentication simple all servers and routers authenticate themselves
to other routers by simple password.

Also note that the format in the configuration file is very raw so if you 
need any help to understand what some setting means please check the
documented example configuration files in doc/ directory.  Mainly, the
example_silcd.conf.

If you want to test this network you should change the IP addresses
in the configuration file or perhaps set IP aliases for you local
machine.
